Web Fundamentals: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML and CSS (along with JavaScript) are the universal languages of front-end browsers, so it goes without saying that you should nail web development basics like HTML and CSS before diving into more difficult back-end technologies. A basic understanding of JavaScript should prove very useful as well.

Luckily, there are plenty of free web development resources and intro to code courses out there to help you get your feet wet in web development and general programming techniques.

As they begin writing code in JavaScript, novice programmers should also spend time getting familiar with algorithms and data structures at a basic level, since becoming familiar with these helps you break problems down into pieces that are more easily solved, across all technologies and languages. This is a real passion of mine, so be on the lookout for another blog post soon, dedicated tothis topic.
Python

Python is an excellent introductory programming language for full-stack developers.

Although it is most popular as a back-end language, it is generally useful in other scenarios. As a general purpose programming language, you can use it to create almost any type of program or software.

Python code is inherently readable, because of an easy-to-learn syntax and an emphasis on good programming style and naming. As an instructor, I appreciate that it even enforces good indentation, which requires programmers to stay very clear on how they organize their loops, conditions and other program logic.

While it’s design is simple, Python is nonetheless incredibly flexible and powerful, which is why a whopping 80 percent of top computer science programs teach Python as an introductory language.
MEAN

MEAN is emerging as one of the industry’s most popular web technology stacks due to its powerful combination of JavaScript-based technologies:

    MongoDB for the database
    Express.js for the web framework
    AngularJS for the frontend framework
    Node.js for the server platform

A few years ago MEAN was just beginning to gain popularity. Now it’s in full swing usage by major tech companies such as Uber, Google, PayPal and Netflix.<br>
